# Survey Creator and Feedback Form Website (In Progress)

This project is a work-in-progress, Django-based feedback form or survey creator website. The goal of this project is to allow companies to create custom feedback forms and surveys, share them via Gmail, and view graphical results of the responses.

## Current Objective

The website will enable companies to:

- Create feedback forms with customizable fields, including text fields, text areas, radio buttons, checkboxes, and select options.
- Save and distribute the forms via Gmail.
- View the results of submitted forms as graphical representations for easier analysis.

## Features (Under Development)

- **Form Builder**: A drag-and-drop interface for creating custom forms with various field types.
- **Email Integration**: Using Gmail API to send survey links to users.
- **Result Visualization**: Display survey results using graphs (with libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly).
- **User Authentication**: Companies can sign up and manage their forms and results securely.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap
- **Database**: SQLite (default, will support other databases later)
- **Email Integration**: Gmail API for sharing forms
- **Graphical Results**: Matplotlib or Plotly (to be implemented)
